The code-setter produces as secrete code which is an arrangement of a number of items which are
defined before the game begins. The code-breaker, with certain help from the code-setter, attempts
to guess the code within a given number of attempts. The game is played by choosing an
arrangement of four colours from a given six, and the exact arrangement has to be reproduced by
the code-breaker.
When the code-breaker has made a guess at the code, the code-setter must mark the guess. This
involves saying how many colours are correct and in the correct position in the arrangement, which
is done by giving a number of black markers; and secondly, saying how many colours are correct
but in the wrong position, this being indicated by white markers.
For example:
Code set BLUE RED YELLOW GREEN
Guess RED GREEN YELLOW BROWN
score 1 BLACK 2 WHITE
The code-breaker then goes on to make another guess, helped this time by the information which
has been received from the first guess.
After several guesses and the information received from each one, it should be possible for the
code-breaker to deduce the correct arrangement. The final score is linked to the number of guesses
made. If the code-breaker is not successful within an agreed number of attempts then the code-setter
has defeated the code-breaker.
